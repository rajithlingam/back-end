To clone and run the **back-end** project from your GitHub repository, hereâ€™s a complete step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Clone the Back-End Repository

1. **Open your terminal** (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or the terminal on Mac/Linux).

2. **Navigate to the directory** where you want to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```

3. **Clone the back-end repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajithlingam/back-end
   ```

4. **Navigate into the cloned folder**:
   ```bash
   cd back-end
   ```

### Step 2: Install Node.js and npm

1. **Download and install Node.js** from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). This will install both **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager).

2. **Verify the installations**:
   - To check if Node.js is installed, run:
     ```bash
     node --version
     ```
   - To check if npm is installed, run:
     ```bash
     npm --version
     ```

### Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

1. Inside the `back-end` project directory (where you cloned the repository), run the following command to install all required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This will install all necessary packages for your back-end project.

### Step 4: Install Nodemon for Automatic Restarting

1. **Install nodemon globally** (you only need to do this once):
   ```bash
   npm install -g nodemon
   ```

2. **Start your back-end server** using `nodemon`:
   ```bash
   nodemon index.js
   ```
   - Replace `index.js` with the entry point for your project (it might be `server.js`, `app.js`, etc.).

### Step 5: Access Your Local Server

- Once `nodemon` starts, it will show something like:
  ```bash
  [nodemon] starting `node index.js`
  Server running at http://localhost:3000
  ```

- Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port defined in your project) to interact with the back-end server.

### Recap of Commands:
```bash
cd path/to/your/directory
git clone https://github.com/rajithlingam/back-end
cd back-end
npm install
npm install -g nodemon
nodemon index.js
```

Now your back-end project should be running on your local machine. Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further assistance!
